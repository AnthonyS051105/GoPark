# Project Persistence Fix - Implementation Guide

## Problem Description
Projects were disappearing after logout/login because they were stored in memory instead of being properly persisted to Firestore with user association.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Project Service (`src/services/projectService.ts`)
- **Before**: Projects stored in memory array that resets on page refresh
- **After**: Projects stored in Firestore with user association

Key changes:
- Added `userId` field to project data structure
- Implemented proper Firestore operations (addDoc, getDocs, etc.)
- Added authentication checks to ensure users only access their own projects
- Added proper error handling and logging

### 2. Updated Modal Context (`src/app/context/modalContext.tsx`)
- Added `clearSavedProjects()` function to clear projects when user logs out
- Updated `loadSavedProjects()` to fetch from Firestore instead of memory
- Added better error handling

### 3. Updated Homepage (`src/app/page.tsx`)
- Added logic to clear projects when user logs out
- Enhanced user authentication state handling
- Improved project loading on user login

### 4. Updated Modal Component (`src/components/modal.tsx`)
- Added call to `loadSavedProjects()` after saving project to ensure consistency
- Removed `addSavedProject()` call in favor of reloading from Firestore

### 5. Updated Firestore Security Rules (`firestore.rules`)
- Added proper security rules for projects collection
- Ensured users can only read/write their own projects
- Added user document access rules

## How to Test the Fix

1. **Login to your account**
2. **Create a new project** using the "Create New" button
3. **Verify the project appears** in the "Your Project" section
4. **Logout** from your account
5. **Login again** with the same credentials
6. **Check if your projects are still visible** - they should be there now!

## Manual Deployment Steps

Since PowerShell execution is restricted, you need to manually deploy the Firestore rules:

1. **Open Firebase Console**: Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. **Select your project**: "smartparking-7af65"
3. **Navigate to Firestore**: Click on "Firestore Database" in the left menu
4. **Go to Rules tab**: Click on the "Rules" tab
5. **Replace the rules** with the content from `firestore.rules` file
6. **Click "Publish"** to deploy the new rules

## Technical Details

### Project Data Structure (Before)
```javascript
// Stored in memory - lost on refresh
let projects = [];
```

### Project Data Structure (After)
```javascript
// Stored in Firestore with user association
{
  id: "auto-generated-id",
  name: "Project Name",
  address: "Project Address",
  images: [...],
  userId: "user-uid", // Links project to user
  createdAt: timestamp,
  updatedAt: timestamp
}
```

### Security Rules
Projects are now protected by Firestore security rules:
- Users can only create projects with their own `userId`
- Users can only read/update/delete projects where `userId` matches their authentication
- Anonymous users cannot access any projects

## Troubleshooting

### If projects still don't persist:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify Firebase configuration in `src/lib/firebase.ts`
3. Ensure Firestore rules are properly deployed
4. Check network tab for failed Firestore requests

### If authentication issues occur:
1. Verify user is properly authenticated before accessing projects
2. Check `AuthContext` for proper user state management
3. Ensure Firebase Auth configuration is correct

### Common Console Logs to Look For:
- `üè† Homepage: User authenticated, loading projects for: [user-uid]`
- `üìä Projects fetched from Firestore: [number]`
- `üíæ Saving project to Firestore for user: [user-uid]`
- `‚úÖ Project saved with ID: [project-id]`

## Next Steps

1. **Test the application** with multiple user accounts
2. **Deploy Firestore rules** using Firebase Console
3. **Monitor application** for any remaining issues
4. **Consider adding data validation** for project fields
5. **Implement project sharing** features if needed

The main issue was that projects were stored in browser memory rather than being properly persisted to a database with user association. This implementation ensures that:
- Projects are permanently stored in Firestore
- Each project is linked to the user who created it  
- Projects persist across logout/login cycles
- Users can only see their own projects
- Data is properly secured with Firestore rules
