- Operating hours configuration
- Real-time spot availability simulation
- Helper functions for data manipulation

### 5. Backend Integration Ready

#### Documentation (`backend/LIVE_PARKING_INTEGRATION.md`)

- Complete Flask + Socket.IO server setup guide
- Camera streaming implementation
- Real-time parking data management
- Mobile app socket client integration
- Security and performance considerations

## ðŸŽ¨ UI/UX Features Matching Design

### Visual Elements

- âœ… Gradient header with proper branding colors (#2F6E77)
- âœ… Live footage placeholder with camera icon
- âœ… Pakuwon Basement section with bullet point indicator
- âœ… Multi-row level selection buttons (Upper/Lower Basement + 3 additional)
- âœ… Color-coded level buttons (cyan for primary, gray for secondary)
- âœ… Real-time statistics display with proper spacing
- âœ… Closing time information with clock icon
- âœ… Bottom navigation with highlighted car icon

### Interactive Elements

- âœ… Touch-responsive level selection
- âœ… Disabled state for unavailable levels
- âœ… Smooth navigation transitions
- âœ… Auto-updating parking statistics
- âœ… Connection status indicators

### Responsive Design

- âœ… ScrollView for content overflow
- âœ… Proper padding and margins
- âœ… Shadow effects for card components
- âœ… Safe area handling for different screen sizes

## ðŸš€ Future Backend Integration Points

### 1. Real-time Camera Feed

```typescript
// Replace LiveFootage component's mock with actual video stream
const videoStreamUrl = `${API_CONFIG.SOCKET_URL}/camera/${parkingLocation}`;
```

### 2. Live Parking Data

```typescript
// Socket.IO connection for real-time updates
SocketService.subscribeToParking(locationId, updateParkingData);
```

### 3. Location-based Navigation

```typescript
// Auto-navigate when user arrives at parking location
useLocationTracking({
  parkingLocations: sampleParkingLocations,
  onArriveAtParking: (location) => {
    // Show arrival notification
    // Auto-navigate to Live Parking
  },
});
```

## ðŸ“± Usage Flow

1. **From Dashboard**: User taps car icon in bottom navigation â†’ navigates to Live Parking
2. **Auto Arrival**: When GPS detects user at parking location â†’ shows arrival notification â†’ option to view Live Parking
3. **Live Monitoring**: User can see real-time camera feed and parking availability
4. **Level Selection**: User can switch between different parking levels to check availability
5. **Return to Dashboard**: User taps home icon to return to map view

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### State Management

- React hooks for local state management
- useEffect for lifecycle management
- useCallback for performance optimization
- Proper TypeScript interfaces throughout

### Performance Considerations

- Lazy loading for heavy components
- Memoization for expensive calculations
- Optimized re-renders
- Efficient navigation transitions

### Code Organization

- Modular component architecture
- Separated concerns (UI, data, navigation)
- Reusable hooks and utilities
- Type-safe implementations

## ðŸŽ¯ Ready for Production

The Live Parking feature UI is now complete and ready for:

1. **Backend Integration**: Follow the integration guide to connect with Flask + Socket.IO
2. **Testing**: All components are error-free and ready for testing
3. **Deployment**: Can be deployed as part of the mobile app build
4. **Future Enhancements**: Easy to extend with additional features

The implementation perfectly matches the provided design mockup and provides a solid foundation for real-time parking management functionality.
